    <h3>This vanilla cake is the result of bringing together the best of Japanese sponge cakes and Western butter based cakes. It has the world renowned very soft, fluffy crumb of Japanese cakes and uses the Japanese baking method, combined with the buttery goodness and sweetness of Western cakes.</h3>
    <P>But it’s more sturdy than Japanese cakes which are so delicate, they can really only be decorated with cream. Anything heavier and the bottom layer gets squished! Also, importantly, this cake incorporates my cake shelf-life requirement to stay perfectly fresh for at least 2 days after it’s made. (This lasts perfectly for 4 days.) Because who bakes cakes on the day they are intended to be served??</P>
    <P>Interestingly, baking experts will recognise the method and ingredients in this cake to be very similar to what is called a Hot Milk Cake in America – albeit strangely it’s often described as a “dense” cake, presumably because they don’t preserve the egg aeration to the extent I insist we do and also because sometimes it’s baked in bundt pans which takes far longer to bake (= dense cake).</P>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups plain / all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>4 large eggs (50 – 55g / 2 oz each)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups caster / superfine sugar </li>
        <li>1 cup milk , full fat</li>
        <li>3 tsp vanilla extract , the best you can afford</li>
        <li>3 tsp vegetable or canola oil </li>
    </ul>
