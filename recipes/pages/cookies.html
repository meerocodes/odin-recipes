    <h3>Ultra thick Bakery Style Chocolate Chip Cookies feature golden brown edges with ooey and gooey centers. This easy recipe can be made in 30 minutes</h3>
    <P>The key to the best soft cookies is to take the chocolate chip cookies out of the oven just before they look like they’re done baking. They should still appear slightly wet in the very center. The residual heat of the oven and pan will finish cooking the cookies through to soft perfection once you allow them to cool completely.</P>
    <P>Also, be sure to measure your flour correctly. Too much flour will lead to dry, dense, or crumbly chocolate chip cookies that barely spread. Check out my article on How to Measure Flour here, it’ll forever improve your baking!</P>
